# The Century OS

This project is a 64-bit focused version of Century-OS.  This version takes from the 32-bit version of Century-OS, but is better streamlined for the 64-bit CPUs (where any 32-bit archs will be added in later if desired).

## Version 0.0.1 -- Complete the x86_64 loader

This version will have just a couple goals:
1. Put the CPU into long mode
1. Find the kernel and jump to it
